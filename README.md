# Viewing Party

Viewing party is a web application that allows you to search through MILLIONS of movie data! Once you've found a movie, you can create an event where you invite your friends, select a date and time, as well as set a duration for a viewing party. The Viewing Party App makes it easy to stay organize whether you are hosting or attending parties.

### About this Project

Viewing party is a web application that consumes themoviedb api (https://www.themoviedb.org/) to gather movie data for planing events. This project utilizes basic authentication to keep track of its' users and self-referential joins to create a friend system. The code produced follows MVC principles as well as a Facade design pattern.
